# c#_demo1
My final project for my associate's degree C# class.

This project was very similar to the web_demo1 project except built using C# and creating an app out of it rather than a website. The project displayed card names, prices, and the card as image from the [scryfall](https://scryfall.com/) site.

This project used a MS SQL database to store the data for the cards. See the statement.sql file for more information on the database.

Project could create, update, delete, modify, and retrieve entries from a localhost SQL database.
 
Video demonstration of the project: N/A .
