# c#_demo1
My final project for my associate's degree C# class.

This project was very similar to the web_demo1 project except built using C# and creating an app out of it rather than a website. The project displayed card names, prices, and the card as image from the [scryfall](https://scryfall.com/) site.

This project used a MS SQL database to store the data for the cards. See the statement.sql file for more information on the database.

Project could create, update, delete, modify, and retrieve entries from a localhost SQL database.
 
Video demonstration of the project: N/A .

Future improvements to the project would be to use the scryfall API to automaically update when the app runs, or goes to retrieve the card on the currently manually entered prices on all the cards, and also retrieve the images for the cards should they change.
